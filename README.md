# Fractal-Art

Adjust the WIDTH and HEIGHT variables to fit your screen accordingly. If you lower the WIDTH and HEIGHT, 
then be prepared to adjust the SCALE variable accordingly to get the most aethestically pleasing image.

If it the image won't render, or if it takes a long time to render, then lower the MAX_ITERATIONS variable
until the render time improves. Start by decreasing it in increments of 1000, and once you reach 1000, then 
try lowering it in increments of 50 - 100.

If you are using a MacBook that has a graphics card, then be aware that disabling graphics switching might 
help make the image render quicker.

Color smoothing and zoom-in/out will soon be available!
